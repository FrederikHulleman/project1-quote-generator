## What the app does
- This app randomly shows quotes, their source and category. Optionally it also shows their year & citation.
- The app refreshes every 10 seconds to display a new quote. Or the button can be used to show a new quote.
- The background color is randomly calculated.
- A font color is then chosen (white or black), which has the best contrast with the background color.
